# Node.js-notes

# History of Node.js
-> Node.js is like a special tool that helps people use JavaScript in a really cool way. It has been around for a long time, even before you were born! It started in 
2009 by someone named Ryan Doll. They made it work with a special engine called Chrome's VA.

In 2011, something important happened. They made a special manager called npm 1.0. It helped people share their code with others. This made it easier for everyone to work together and make cool things with Node.js.

In 2015, some big companies like IBM, Microsoft, and PayPal joined together to make sure Node.js keeps growing and getting better. They formed a group called the Node.js Foundation. They work together to make sure Node.js is used in lots of different places and helps lots of people.

People who use Node.js are really happy. They have big meetings and events all over the world to talk about it. It's used in many different industries to do all sorts of amazing things.
